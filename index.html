                <p>I am an Idaho native and a mom of three. A college athlete and an artist. I graduated from The College of Idaho with honors in 2011 with a Bachelors of Arts in Business Administration and a Bachelors of Arts in Fine Art. I also had a minor in Digital Media and a minor in Marketing. Some may call that overachieving, I call it indecision. I found so many things I was interested in while I was in college I simply could not make up my mind!</p>

                <p>By the time I graduated I had exactly zero work experience. My "job" had been being a collegiate basketball player (which was more of a time commitment than a full time job, if I'm being honest). Prior to graduation I had stumbled across an internship called the Disney College Program. I have always been a bit of a Disney buff (aka nerd) so I decided to persue it. In March of my senior year of college, after literally months of waiting, I found out I had been offered the position. I was extatic. So exactly a week after graduation I moved away from the only state I had ever known to pursue this dream. It is still one of my fondest memories in my life. If I am ever given the chance, I would go back to Disney in a heartbeat.</p>

                <p>Once my time at Disney was up, I found my way into a job at a bank. I spent five years working in lending. During that time I earned my MBA and worked my way up in the company, but I was ready for a change. On a whim I applied for a job at a FinTech company in Boise. I had never worked in a true finance field, or a tech field but I applied anyhow. After one of the most nervewracking interviews I have ever had, I was offered a job as a Senior Client Service Analyst. Through this job I have had the opportunity to gain exposure to a variety of platforms and programs and it has piqued my interest in the world of coding. So here I am! I look forward to meeting you.</p>
